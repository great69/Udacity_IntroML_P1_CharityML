# Project 1: Finding Donor for CharityML
This is the first project for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program to learn about Supervised Learning.

## Install
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

## Files
- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main notebook to analyze the data using supervised learning algorithms along with visualizations
- `finding_donors.html`: HTML format of the notebook for viewing in browser
- `visuals.py`: The supporting code for visualizations
- `census.csv`: The dataset for training and cross-validating
- `test_census.csv`: The test dataset to evaluate the learning algorithms

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data
The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",_ by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
